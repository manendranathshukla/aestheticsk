I can field this one, hosting many Django and a couple of Rails apps on AWS. Some of this depends on what you want, but I’m going to assume you’re like me, and you want to sleep at night, and as a result you’re willing to spend a little extra. Here’s what you’ll need, and what you can expect it to cost (from least to most):

Route53: $1.50
You probably have at least one hosted zone here (we’ll say 3 or 4), otherwise dealing with your load balancer DNS can be ugly (some services support A records as FQDNs, though Route53 is by far the easiest)
CloudWatch Dashboards: $3
Each dashboard is ~$3 / mo
EBS: $10
You’ll need to keep some storage for your EC2 instances, I put 25 or 50GB in mine
This will also cover the cost of traffic through the ELB for small amounts of traffic, and will represent a variable cost based on usage
EC2: $27
I have at least two t2.micro instances running at all times, Autoscaling Groups are FREE, and I would enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring (at the cost of $5 / mo / instance, or so), and create scale up and down alarms based on these metrics
You can scale up to the point you’re comfortable with (I allow up to 8 instances that scale up and down automatically with traffic patterns, looking at latency and CPU utilization)
I also have two NAT Gateway machines, one in each of the AZs that I use, for security, with routing hooked up appropriately (this is factored into the cost above)
These NAT Gateway machines are less expensive than the NAT Gateways offered as part of VPCs until you hit higher scale
RDS: $77
I have one DB instance, a db.t2.small, running PostgreSQL
This is where you’ll spend the most money, and it’s because my DB has a replica, which means automated failover
This also includes automated backups, of which I keep the last 5 days
Total cost per month? ~$119. And you can sleep at night knowing the system won’t be offline for more than ~5 minutes.
